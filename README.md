## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Finally got to get some experience with @mobile, not so scary... for now! Used more flexbox and got a BIT more comfortable with it also. 
Found out about :nth-child(), which might be the easiest way for this project?


### Continued development

Definitely CSS is deep, looking forward to dive deeper on later practice projects.
After this one I will commit to a 30 hour course on Udemy to expand knowledge in HTML and CSS.. will also do the same for javascript when it comes into play.
Some certifications might also be useful.


### Useful resources

- [W3 scools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Still the first choice!
- [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - For now still need this reference.
